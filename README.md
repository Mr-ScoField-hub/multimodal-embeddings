# Multimodal Neural Network: Images and Language

This is a hands-on experiment exploring how a neural network can **connect images and language**. Images and captions are transformed into embeddings that the network can relate, allowing it to perceive and reason across modalities.

## Explore the Project

* Upload an image and provide a text caption
* Generate embeddings and visualize them as a structured grid
* Hover to inspect values, copy or download embeddings for further use

## Why It Matters

Real-world data is rarely just text or just images. Connecting both enables:

* Smarter search and recommendations
* Context-aware insights
* Foundational research for multimodal AI systems

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multimodal-embedding.git
cd multimodal-embedding
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Ensure your backend API is running (example: `http://localhost:8080`)
